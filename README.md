# MaSMaker
An Open-Source, Portable Software to Create and Integrate Maze-like Surfaces into Arbitrary Geometries

MaSMaker aims to provide an easy-to-use and self-contained tool to embed geometrically customized TPMS-based structures into CAD models with an arbitrary geometry. The software is distributed in two different ways. The first distribution consists on the source code for the generation of TPMS structures using the Python programming language. The main distribution corresponds to a portable, executable file in which all the required libraries and packages have been included. This distribution has an easy-to-use GUI in order to facilitate the manipulation and integration of TPMS structures into arbitrary geometries represented by a STL file.

The software tool allows to control the main parameters of this kind of structures (isovalue, cell resolution and unit cell size). MaSMaker is distributed under the GPLv3 license.

Executable version can be found in the release MaSMaker v1.0 (https://github.com/CONMAD-CIDESIMX/MaSMaker/releases/tag/v1.0)
